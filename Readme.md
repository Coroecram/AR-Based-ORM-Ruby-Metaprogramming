#Active Record Lite
## Overview
Active Record Lite is a project designed to help teach the principles behind SQL and ActiveRecord. Using Ruby and heredocs, the user is taked to create the tools required to make ActiveRecordesque models and tables following the RSpecs provided. In the end, the models have instance variables set to their column values, separate models can be associated with foriegn keys, and tables can be populated. It was a difficult project because I was unfamiliar with both SQL and active record but, looking back on it now, I am very proud at the skills and knowledge I have attained in both.
