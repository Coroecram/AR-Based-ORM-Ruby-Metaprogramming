#Active Record Lite
## Overview
Active Record Lite is a project designed to help teach the principles behind SQL and ActiveRecord. Using Ruby and heredocs, the user is set the task of creating associatable models and tables following the RSpecs provided. It was a difficult project because I was unfamiliar with both SQL and active record. But, looking back on it now, I am proud at the skills I have attained in both.
