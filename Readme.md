#Active Record Lite
## Overview
This is a project completed to help teach myself the principles behind SQL, ActiveRecord, and TDD. Using Rspec to layout the basic functionality of Active Record and Ruby Metaprogramming and SQL Queries via Heredocs to carry it out, the user is able to create ActiveRecordesque models and tables. The models have instance variables set to their column values, separate models can be associated with foreign keys, and tables can be populated. It was a difficult project because I was unfamiliar with both SQL and ActiveRecord but, looking back on it now, I am very proud at the skills and knowledge I have attained in both along with an appreciation for the TDD methodology.
